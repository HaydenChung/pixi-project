# pixi-project
Where I learn to build with pixi.

<hr>

Learning to use pixi.js.
The project should build with es6's syntax and oop structure.

5-12-2016   .......start from here.

6-12-2016   Start working on sprite!

7-12-2016   Add a animation class to handle sprite motion.

PS.Use firefox or IE-edge to view the index page,or else host a local server,for Chrome and some other browser won't load local image,(Cross-origin request.)it seem PIXI has a method to work with this issue,will look into it.

PS2.The app.js file lay in the build folder was compressed,check the src folder instead.
